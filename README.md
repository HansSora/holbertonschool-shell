# Introduction to Shell Scripting

## What is a Shell?

A shell is a command-line interface that provides users with a way to interact with their operating system. It allows users to execute commands, run scripts, and perform various tasks efficiently, primarily through text-based commands.

## Types of Shells

There are several types of shells available in Unix-like operating systems, such as Bash (Bourne Again SHell), Zsh (Z Shell), Ksh (Korn Shell), and more. Each shell has its own set of features and functionalities, but Bash is one of the most commonly used shells and is the default shell for many Linux distributions.

## Shell Scripting

Shell scripting is the process of writing scripts or programs using shell commands and syntax to automate tasks, perform system administration, or accomplish various other objectives. Shell scripts are plain text files that contain a series of commands and instructions that the shell executes sequentially.
